# Hey! I'm Jesse Pence! This is my portfolio!

Not much to say here, but thanks for checking out my Github repository so thoroughly! If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me on Github or Twitter, or you can use the e-mail form on my website. I hope you have a great day!

## About the Portfolio

It's just an Astro project built with vanilla JS and UnoCSS. I just used this as an excuse to play with Uno, and it's pretty cool. I'll probably still use Tailwind for most projects, though.

Hilariously, this was originally my first React project ever. It was mostly a 1-1 copy of some Youtube tutorial, and it used create-react-app. Since then, in true Ship of Theseus fashion, almost every part of it has been replaced.

Eventually, as I grew more experienced, I realized that a mostly-static portfolio did not need React at all. So, I switched to Astro, and the Lighthouse score instantly doubled. It's a bit much with the animations and the crazy background, but I like it and I think it represents my silly personality well.
