        I'm currently working as a freelance web developer. I've built a few
        websites used in production by small businesses. My biggest project to

        built using React Server Components. It allows the owners to update every
        single aspect of their website without having to write a single line of code,
        and it's blazing fast!

        I'm also constantly working on open source projects-- both on my own and
        with other developers. My most popular project has been

        I built it as a challenge to myself to see how many features I could fit into a jQuery-esque
        library using modern web APIs with only 5kb of code after gzip. It's over nine times smaller than jQuery, and
        it's able to do so much more than jQuery ever could.

      <p class="text-left p-2">
        It includes automatic error handling and promise unwrapping, HTML streaming and server-sent events, and a 
        ton of other features. I think I did pretty well. It currently has just over fifty stars on Github.

        My last restaurant job was bar manager of a fine-dining steakhouse in
        the heart of Old Louisville, Kentucky. I was responsible for training
        new employees, managing the bar, ordering inventory, and ensuring that
        the restaurant ran smoothly when the general manager was not present. I
        also curated multiple cocktail menus which gave me the opportunity to
        flex my creative muscles.
      </p>
      <p class="text-left p-2">
        Covid-19 and my step-father's death forced me to move here to Portland,
        Oregon. During this time, I quit drinking and decided to pursue a career
        in web development. Sometimes, I miss the restaurant industry, but I'm
        grateful that this disruption in my life allowed me to discover my true
        passion. And, I think that my creativity and leadership skills that I
        honed as a bar manager will serve me well as a developer.
